Run scripts run-interactively
=============================

The python scripts (``intra_checks.py`` for the internal checks,
and ``inter_checks.py`` for the neighbour/buddy checks)
run through each station in turn, applying the relevant tests.
These, and the top-level test functions are documented below.

The main reason to run interactively is to do development, fix a bug/
improve a QC-check's functionality, or to investigate what is
being flagged in an individual station.

.. automodule:: find_neighbours

.. automodule:: inter_checks
