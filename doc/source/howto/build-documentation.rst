Building the documentation
==========================

To build this Sphinx documentation to include all the doc-strings from the scripts into a pretty html file:

.. code:: console

    conda activate glamod_QC
    cd doc
    make html


Then you can open the ``index.html`` in the `doc/build/html/` directory.
